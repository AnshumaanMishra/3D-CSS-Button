# 3D-CSS-Buttons
3D buttons with click animation using only `CSS`

The module uses the box shadow and `before` and `after` pseudo elements to cleate a cuboidal box and cylindrical illusion. 

The press animation is created by:  
1. The box shadow offset is decreased, so it becomes closer to the object. This makes it look like the button is pressed.
2. The cylinder(circular) shadow initially has 9 layers. When 2 layers are removed, the distance decreases. This creates the button-press effect.
